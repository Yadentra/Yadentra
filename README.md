## Fun Fact:
Programmers often use a technique called "rubber duck debugging" where they explain their code problem to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck. This surprisingly helps them find the solution!
## Hobbies:
I enjoy staying active through hiking, running, and playing golf. I also find relaxation and inspiration through music, reading, and watching Formula 1 and football.
